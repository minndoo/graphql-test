# graphql-test
This is just my playground with graphql, I am trying to work with GraphQL both on frontend and backend, also I use custom mongodb database with filled data

If you want to see and try the example:
clone this repo
navigate into server folder
then in terminal run `yarn app-install` to install dependencies
after that run `yarn dev` to serve the app
